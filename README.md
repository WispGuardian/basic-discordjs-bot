# basic-discordjs-bot
A very simple start to a Discord bot.

## Getting Started
- Go to http://discordapp.com/developers
- Create a new app</p>
- On the left sidebar, go to the "Bot" tab and create a bot user
- Note: your bot token is found here.
- Grab your bot's token and go to the config.json file. Replace ```your_token_here``` with your bot's token. It should look something like this: ```NTE3NDQ2MjY2dNzIxNjc0.DuCVEQ.7ctjEt38cc-6oC3f1WQgsQNKay8```
- Shift+Right Click in the folder your bot files are in. Select "Open command prompt here" or "Open PowerShell window here", then run the following commands: ```npm init -y``` then ```npm install discord.js```

## Quick Hosting Guide
- Open the command/PowerShell window in the folder again.
- Type the command: ```node app.js```
  - This will run the bot until you terminate it/close the window.
  - For 24/7 hosting, I recommend getting access to a VPS and using it to host your bot(s).

From there, everything is up to you. This project is meant as a starting place for new bot developers. If you need help with bot development, along with other programming/hacking stuff, you can join the HackTimes Discord server (https://discord.gg/r3txUkG). This server is not owned by myself, but I am active on it if you want my help specifically.

#### If any of the command prompt/powershell commands did not work for you, perform a couple quick Google searches about npm and nodejs.
